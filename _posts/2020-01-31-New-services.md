We are monitoring the development of web hosting and Internet services, so we decided to launch a new service. We are always the first to introduce new technologies, new domains, we are maximally responsible and correct to our clients, we are a partner you can trust.
We uncompromisingly choose the best for our partners.
Our servers are co-located at **_Contabo's_** best-in-class datacenter, ensuring premium bandwidth and fastest access (lowest ping! higgest performance!).

*![Alt]({{ baseurl }}/postImages/plesk.jpg "Plesk")*

Our servers are based on linux OS ([Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)) with the latest plesk panel ([Obsidian](https://www.plesk.com/)), with mandatory constant updating and maintenance of the service available to you for 0-24 hours.

- The backup is started every day and is saved if there is a need for a restore 
  
- Each user receives login information for a plesk panel from which they can manage their web site, mail

**_TomeksDEV_** will offer web hosting packages of **_1GB_** up to **_30GB_**, and for some larger packages it can be requested at [info&commat;tomeksdev&period;com](mailto:info&commat;tomeksdev&period;com). In addition to web hosting packages, we will also be offering **_Wordpress_** packages.

Of course, as a service company, we can do a copy of the entire website at your request.
