Ladies and gentlemen, server enthusiasts, Linux aficionados, and curious wanderers of the web, gather 'round because I've got some exciting news to share! I've just launched my very own cyber haven, a place where bits and bytes dance the fandango and servers take center stage. Welcome to my digital circus - or as the cool kids call it, my brand-spanking-new website!

Let's dive right into the meat and potatoes of this technological extravaganza. So, picture this: I hail from the land of Croatia, a place where the sun shines brighter when you mention servers, Linux, and scripts in the same breath. Yes, you guessed it right! My website is going to be the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance of tech-talk, where I'm going to dish out more geeky goodness than a motherboard has pins.

You see, I'm not just your run-of-the-mill tech geek. I'm Tomo, also known as the "Vujca" - the czar of code, the sultan of servers, the maestro of multitasking! With over a decade of rubbing shoulders with networks, I'm like a digital Sherlock Holmes, solving mysteries of connectivity and blazing a trail through the tangled wilderness of cables.

Now, what can you expect from this carnival of code? Buckle up, because we're taking a wild ride through the tech universe! From Linux - my one true love - to scripts that are as magical as a unicorn on roller skates, I'm leaving no stone unturned. But that's not all. Ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes when you're installing systems from every corner of the digital cosmos? Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android - theyâ€™re all getting a spotlight moment on my website.

But wait, there's more! Step right up, folks, as I unveil the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance: my lab rack. It's not your grandma's dusty attic; it's a treasure trove of testing, a playground where operating systems romp and scripts frolic. Here, the phrase "what happens in the lab rack, stays in the lab rack" has never been truer. From experimental Linux concoctions to watching Windows and MacOS hold hands (figuratively, of course), my lab rack is where the real magic unfolds.

And just to give you a little teaser, let me throw some system names your way - Proxmox, VMware, Hyper-V, Openstack, KVM - they're not just random letters, they're my partners in crime in this grand tech escapade. Not to forget the hardware heroes like HPE MSA, Synology, and TrueNAS, who turn my lab rack into a symphony of storage solutions.

So, dear readers, if you're up for a laugh, a sprinkle of geekiness, and a whole lot of tech-talk, join me on this rollercoaster journey of servers, Linux, scripts, and the wild world of installations. My website isn't just another URL; it's a rabbit hole of knowledge, a vortex of virtualization, and a hub of hilarity.

Keep your seatbelts fastened, your coffee mugs filled, and your sense of adventure primed â€“ because we're about to rock the digital realm like never before. Here's to my new website, where ones and zeros meet laughter and learning in a fusion that's more electrifying than a lightning storm in a server room! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–
