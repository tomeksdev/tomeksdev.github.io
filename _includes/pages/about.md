# Hey, it's Tomo (aka Vujca)!

I'm a Croatian system and network architect with 10+ years of experience designing resilient infrastructure across Europe. From virtualization clusters and storage fabrics to hardened firewalls, I love taking on messy environments and turning them into dependable platforms. Lately I've been spearheading datacenter builds in Germany—mixing Linux, automation, and enterprise networking to keep services fast, secure, and always available.

## Short...
I hail from Croatia and I'm a Network and System Administrator with over a decade of experience working across various countries, including Austria and Germany. Over the years, I've tackled numerous challenges related to virtualization, networking, firewalls, and a ton of other cool tech stuff that comes with the territory.

## More...
Linux technologies keep me inspired every day. For the past two years I've been building a new datacenter in Germany, tinkering with resilient virtualization stacks, automated deployments, airtight security, and fast storage fabrics. If it's complex infrastructure, I'm probably already experimenting with it.

## Technologies...
I'm hands-on with Proxmox, VMware, Hyper-V, OpenStack, KVM, HPE MSA, Synology, TrueNAS, Unraid, QNAP, Linux, Windows, macOS, Cisco, Aruba, Mikrotik, Sophos, OPNSense, SonicWall, HPE, Dell, IBM, Lenovo, Fujitsu, Supermicro—and plenty more.

So, if you need help with your IT environment, just give me a holler!
