# Hey, it's Tomo (aka Vujca)!

## Short...
I hail from Croatia and I'm a Network and System Administrator with over a decade of experience working across various countries, including Austria and Germany. Over the years, I've tackled numerous challenges related to virtualization, networking, firewalls, and a ton of other cool tech stuff that comes with the territory.

## More...
You know what really floats my boat? Linux technologies! I'm a huge fan of everything Linux and consider myself to be a pretty darn good System and Network administrator. In fact, for the past two years, I've been working on a new datacenter in Germany and I absolutely love tinkering with all sorts of powerful and secure system solutions for virtualization, data security, big networks, and more.

## Technologies...
Some of the technologies that I'm a total pro at include Proxmox, VmWare, Hyper-V, Openstack, KVM, HPE MSA, Synology, Server storage, TrueNAS, Unraid, QNAP, Linux, Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, WindowsPhone, Cisco, Aruba, HPE, TeliedAllesis, Mikrotik, Sophos, SecurePoint, OPNSense, SonicWall, HPE, Dell, IBM, Lenovo, Fujitsu, and Supermicro. Phew, that's quite a list, isn't it?

So, if you need any help with your IT needs, just give me a holler!
