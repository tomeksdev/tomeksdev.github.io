I keep tracking to a minimum. This page explains what is collected, which cookies are used, and how you can control them.

## Data controller

- **Site owner:** TomeksDEV (Tomo Novak)  
- **Contact:** [info@tomeksdev.com](mailto:info@tomeksdev.com)

## Data I do not collect

- No advertising pixels.  
- No analytics are active by default.  
- No cross-site tracking.

## Cookies and consent categories

| Category | Purpose | Examples | Can be disabled? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Strictly necessary | Keep the site secure and remember your consent choice. | `td_cookie_consent_v1` (stored in localStorage) | No |
| Functional | Load the comments widget provided by Giscus (GitHub Discussions). | Giscus client script may set local storage in your browser to remember preferences. | Yes |
| Analytics (optional) | Reserved for privacy-friendly analytics in the future. Disabled unless you opt in. | _None in use right now._ | Yes |

Use the **Cookie preferences** button in the footer or the consent banner to adjust these choices at any time.

## Comments (Giscus)

Comments are powered by [Giscus](https://giscus.app), which uses GitHub Discussions. When you enable functional cookies and interact with the widget:

- Your GitHub account may be used to post comments.  
- Giscus may store a few settings in your browser (e.g., theme, session) but does not place advertising or marketing cookies.  
- Your interactions are subject to GitHub's privacy policy.

If you keep functional cookies disabled, the comments component will not load.

## Logs and hosting

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages. Standard web server logs (e.g., IP address, user agent, and requested pages) may be captured by GitHub for security and operations. These logs are not used for profiling by TomeksDEV.

## Your rights

You can request access to, correction of, or deletion of any personal data you have provided. Contact [info@tomeksdev.com](mailto:info@tomeksdev.com) for requests.

## Updates

This policy may change as the site evolves. The last update was on {{ "now" | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}.
